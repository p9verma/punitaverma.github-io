# Projects
Here are some of my projects:

## Longformer Research Project
[Publication Replicated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150)
Implemented **sliding window attention** from the Longformer in **GPT**,  demonstrating improvements on computational efficiency and scalability to handle longer sequences. Experimented with wikitext-103 dataset to measure training complexities, cross-entropy loss, and perplexity for both standard self-attention and sliding window models. Aimed to demonstrate linear complexity over quadratic complexity for large-scale document classification tasks.

## Financial Advising Agent
[Code](https://github.com/peterphan1101/Artificial_Intelligence_Projects/blob/main/FinancialAdvisor/extract_financial_info.py)
Designed and implemented a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to optimize financial decision-making by providing real-time data retrieval and context-aware responses for financial analysis. Integrated OpenAI APIs, LangChain, and Edgar dataset for enhanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling more accurate and contextual responses in the financial domain. Employed RAGAS framework to evaluate agent on RAG response times, hallucination rates, precision, and recall.

## ML Capstone Project: Multi-pronged Attention Network for Stock Forecasting (MAN-SF)
Developed an ML model integrating **multiple data modalities**, such as social media text (**sentiment analysis**) and time series data, to enhance stock price forecasting accuracy and understanding of market trends. Improved model accuracy by 12% over standard methods and demonstrated the effectiveness of PCA in reducing noise in stock market data. Evaluated the model using real-time stock data and presented findings.

## Big Fat Charity
[Code](https://github.com/bubbajoe/BigFatCharity)
- Winner, HackDuke Capital One Best Financial Hack
- Created an application to allow users to make informed and efficient charity donations using Big Data analysis , used Google Maps API to visualize and compare charity need and information from over 8000 charities
- Provided an interactive map to visualize charity need in the US on 5 metrics and average overall score using Google Maps API

## RISE Webapp
- Top 4 - JPMorgan Code For Good Hackathon
- Created an application using the LAMP stack for non-profit organization RISE to enable civilians to take legal action
